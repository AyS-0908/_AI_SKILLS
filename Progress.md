# Progress.md - AI Skills

Last updated: 2026-07-18

## Current Objective

System design DECIDED and published in `SKILLS-DESIGN.md` (read that first). `code-audit-loop` finished and published (items 1+2 of its `skill_plan.md`). NEXT: item 3 — live test of the loop on GO_VIRAL D-1b (awaiting user go, costly run).

## Done (recent skills work)

Condensed: one line per change, decisions only. The narrative is in `git log`; each skill's own rules live in its `SKILL.md`.

- 2026-07-18: Fixed the recurring `.dist` propagation gap in `github-sync`: a skill publish now means any changed path under `skill-*` (`SKILL.md`, references, scripts, or assets), not only `SKILL.md`. This closes the mismatch introduced when packaging expanded to full skill folders while the older trigger stayed narrow.

- 2026-07-18: Updated `prompt-engineer/references/sol-5-6.md` from current official GPT-5.6 and ChatGPT prompting guidance. The reference now targets desktop/web use, favors lean outcome-led prompts, adds action/approval boundaries, source and input guidance, concrete style control, and final checks, while excluding API-only configuration. Canonical skill validation and manual lint passed; no live GPT-5.6 forward-test was run for this reference-only revision.

- 2026-07-17: Corrected `company-culture` so every new engagement summarizes and confirms known context, asks no more than three material questions, and waits before drafting; created `hr-strategy-roadmap` as a guided DOER that links business priorities to workforce implications, checks employer foundations, selects 3-5 priorities, and builds a measurable 12-month roadmap. Both passed canonical validation, deterministic acceptance checks, manual positive/near-miss trigger review, and source-to-`.dist`/Claude/Codex/manifest hash checks. `Sync-SkillsManifest.ps1 -NoPush` installed and packaged both locally; GitHub push was intentionally skipped because unrelated Nestor work is dirty.
- 2026-07-17: Added the one-time `nestor-reflection` Google template setup: a duplicate-safe Apps Script generator creates six exact neutral Docs/Sheets templates, including real Google Doc tabs and fixed tables; the existing Form Builder remains one explicit manual bound-script step. Local schema, syntax, reconciliation, and canonical skill validation pass. A live authorized Drive run remains unproven.
- 2026-07-17: Added `skill-nestor-reflection/references/user-guide.md`: a short, non-technical guide covering launch, validation gates, the three methods, resumption, and email safety.
- 2026-07-17: Implemented `skill-nestor-reflection` as a guided reflection pipeline with Interviews, Data research, and Brainstorming branches; fixed Google artifact schemas, reliable-source gates, approval/resume rules, and a bound Docs Apps Script that creates one Form plus linked response Sheet with fingerprinted duplicate prevention and fault-tested recovery. Canonical skill validation and a fresh independent audit pass; the temporary harness was removed. A live Google pilot remains unproven.

- 2026-07-17: Created, validated, and published `skill-company-culture` as a DOER for culture diagnosis, principles, behaviours, rituals, and rollout in 50-250-person SMBs. It uses sourced Gallup, MIT Schein, Atlassian, CIPD, and official employer guidance, with a Dapple-aware project context. Scoped GitHub sync kept unrelated `skill-nestor-reflection` planning work untouched; `Sync-SkillsManifest.ps1 -NoPush` rebuilt the manifest, global Claude/Codex mirrors, and `.dist/company-culture.skill`.
- 2026-07-15: Merged prompt generation into one active `prompt-engineer` skill. Its short `SKILL.md` holds only the shared workflow and deterministic routing; it loads either `references/fable-5.md`, `references/sol-5-6.md`, or neither. The obsolete standalone `skill-prompt-fable-5` was removed. Addon compliance was completed as `GUIDED`: explicit IF/THEN rules, reference/documentation failure handling, manual negative-trigger checks, and navigation for the long Fable reference. Repository validation passed. The project sync ran with `-NoPush -SkipInstall`: the manifest now names only `prompt-engineer`, `.dist/prompt-engineer.skill` was built, and stale `.dist/prompt-fable-5.skill` was pruned. No generated prompt has yet been executed by Fable 5.
- 2026-07-15: Fixed `.skill` packaging after Claude.ai rejected `prompt-engineer.skill`: Windows `Compress-Archive` stored nested paths with `\`. `Sync-SkillsManifest.ps1` now writes `/` paths through the .NET ZIP API, excludes dev-metadata directories, validates every archived path, and rebuilt all 13 packages with `-NoPush -SkipInstall`.
- 2026-07-15: `doc-hygiene` pass on the root docs. Merged `Architecture.md` into `AGENTS.md` and retired `README.md` (both in `_to_delete_2026-07-15/`) — at 13 flat skill folders neither earned a file. Fixed 7 doc-vs-code falsehoods; killed the hardcoded skill count (had drifted 12→13). Decision recorded: three fresh-auditor rounds each returned FAIL (7, 9, 8 defects) on the pass's own diff — twice for cardinal errors (a true fact deleted, the publish gate inverted). The maker cannot grade its own diff; a standalone `doc-hygiene` run needs the fresh-auditor step.
- 2026-07-15: Created and PUBLISHED `skill-prompt-fable-5/` (v1 `d9eb4cc`, v2 `9761ff1`). A prompt *generator*, not a Fable 5 manual. Core constraint: Fable 5 degrades under over-instruction, so the skill picks ≤4 directives from a trigger table rather than pasting all 13. Verification finding with no other home: the minimum cacheable prefix is **per-model** — Fable 5 is **2048** tokens (Opus 4.8/4.7/4.6/4.5 + Haiku 4.5 = 4096; Sonnet 4.5 and older = 1024), refuting the bundled `claude-api` skill's `<unverified>` 512 claim. v1 shipped defective: the trigger table described directives instead of selecting them; v2 made every IF a yes/no question about the task. **Rejected twice, on the record:** embedding the table in the generated prompt for Fable 5 to self-select — it pastes every directive into context (over-instruction is what is IN the prompt, not what the model deems relevant) and makes the prompt unauditable.
- 2026-07-15: Rebuilt and PUBLISHED `skill-appscript` (`d94851e`). Audit confirmed: documentation-heavy, too few executable rules. The `playbook/` folder is gone, replaced by a flat set with each rule next to its "how". Driver: forward tests showed a BUILD agent shipping code that contradicted the rule it cited (held a lock across UrlFetch) because the rule existed only as prose — so the recipes became copy-paste with embedded `selfCheck_*`, proven by an offline harness (`references/tools/gas_mock_run.js`, 15 checks / 11 code blocks at `d94851e`). Verified at publish: all 42 rule IDs present exactly once, no dangling refs.
- 2026-07-14: Owner approved the Apps Script product path: bound MVP → small versioned namespaced library (~20-user testing) → Sheets Editor add-on using Google's official add-on CSS. No checkbox-as-button, no third-party UI framework by default, CardService only when active-document context is unnecessary.
- 2026-07-14: Externally audited the Apps Script playbook against official Google guidance (10/10 platform claims confirmed). Evidence log was archived at `references/archive/validation.md` — see Next Action 3.
- 2026-07-09: `doc-hygiene` passed its first live test (on AI4CEO, per its `skill_plan.md` findings; the same-day pass on this repo's docs is `1ff06e2`). 6 test-feedback improvements encoded into its `SKILL.md`. Its `skill_plan.md` remains: items 1+2 done, item 3 (ownership map hardcoded to `code-GO_VIRAL` filenames) open.
- 2026-07-09: `SKILLS-DESIGN.md` rewritten as the system backbone (`18e7261`). Delegate-then-audit: writer → fresh auditor → fix.
- 2026-07-09: `code-audit-loop` Models & effort rules encoded, rank-based, auditor ≥ coder (`8c28d09`).
- 2026-07-09: Fixed `Sync-SkillsManifest.ps1` em-dash crash on Windows PowerShell 5 (scheduled sync was silently broken).
- Published `skill-code-audit/` (Tier 1/2/3 findings). The `_Audit-IT/` report-file convention was dropped in `cc28e16` (07-05), then the skill was renamed from `skill-audit-it` in `ba6a6e6` (07-13) — see `skill-code-audit/SKILL.md` for the current output contract.
- Published `skill-ideasup-flow/` (07-06): Pain→…→Specification. Stage 4 Business Plan and Stage 8 AI-Coder rules remain MISSING SOURCE.
- Published `skill-benchmark/` (07-08), `skill-hostinger/`. Fixed `skill-github-sync` commit-push: pre-staged paths outside `--files` now fail fast.

## In Progress

- None open beyond the Current Objective.

## Next Action

1. **The Fable branch of `prompt-engineer` has never been proven end-to-end.** Generator-side tests pass, but no prompt it wrote has been executed by Fable 5. A prompt to audit `skill-code-audit` is ready to paste at `high` effort. Until one runs, the branch's central bet — that one to four picked directives beat a hand-written prompt — is reasoned, not observed.
2. Await user go for the `code-audit-loop` live test — see Current Objective above.
3. **UNCOMMITTED `skill-appscript` work, not from the doc pass:** 6 modified (`SKILL.md`; `references/`: `apis-ui.md`, `build-operate.md`, `build-patterns.md`, `data-sheets.md`, `tools/gas_mock_run.js`), 3 deleted (all of `references/archive/`), and an untracked `references/starter/` tree (10 files). Decide: intended work-in-progress, or an accident? Then commit or restore. Until then the `references/archive/` pointers above are broken, and the harness reports 17 checks / 13 code blocks in the working tree vs 15/11 at `d94851e`. NOTE: the 3h sync task auto-commits (`git add -A`) — this will publish itself.
4. Optional: `SKILLS-DESIGN.md` §7/§8 carry live state that duplicates this file — it is why both drifted, and "item 3 open" now lives in 4 places. Both are accurate today; pointing them here instead is a structural call, not a fix.
5. Open thread on `skill-appscript`: decide what else to make deterministic. Rule tables (A/P/S/D/T/C/U/E/V) carry an "applies when" gate + DO/DO NOT with no executable check; SPEC mode has no template; fallback output schemas permit superficial compliance (only AUDIT forces proof via `evidence_gate`).
6. Run `TemplateGenerator.js` once in an authorized Google account, bind `FormBuilder.js` to the generated Interview Working Doc, then run one live `nestor-reflection` Survey pilot. Local checks pass, but live template generation, authorization, Form creation, response linking, and Gmail drafts are not yet proven end to end.
7. Run the first real Dapple prompts for `company-culture` and `hr-strategy-roadmap`. Confirm each first response summarizes known context, asks for confirmation, asks at most three missing questions, and does not draft the substantive deliverable. Upload the two `.dist` packages manually to Claude.ai Settings > Skills when desired.

## Last Verification

- Date: 2026-07-18
- Method: Root-cause history review; scoped diff check; canonical validation of `github-sync`; manual RIGID-skill lint against the skill-creator addon gates.
- Result: The source trigger now covers the complete skill folder, closing the reference/script/asset propagation gap. Unrelated dirty `skill-appscript` files remain untouched.

## Known Risks

- The Fable branch of `prompt-engineer` is unproven end-to-end (Next Action 1).
- Two design gaps open: Spec→Plan (GAP #1) and the over-engineering check (GAP #2) — see `SKILLS-DESIGN.md` §7.
- Publishing is a standing constraint, not a risk — see `AGENTS.md` § Publishing.

## Relocated (off-topic — owning doc elsewhere)

VPS / n8n / Gmail weekly-review automation facts are DevOps, not skills-workbench state → see `_DEVOPS` and `skill-hostinger/reference/weekly-review.md`.
